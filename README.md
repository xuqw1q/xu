In this study, we propose an attention mechanism-based transformer model for automatic modulation classification 
(AMC) by dividing the IQ signal sequence into fixed-length segments and capturing complex spatio-temporal feature 
associations using a multilayer transformer. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of this model 
at 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio is improved by 25% and 15% over typical CNN and ResNet models, respectively.
